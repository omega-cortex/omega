# Functionalities: Gateway (Core + Pipeline + Routing)

## Overview

The central gateway orchestrates the full message pipeline from arrival through authentication, context building, keyword-gated prompt composition, model routing, provider call, marker processing, and response delivery. It also manages background tasks (summarizer, scheduler, heartbeat, CLAUDE.md maintenance).

## Functionalities

| # | Name | Type | Location | Description | Dependencies |
|---|------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Gateway struct | Model | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:80` | Central gateway holding all runtime state: provider, channels, memory, audit, configs, prompts, skills, projects, model_fast/complex, active_senders mutex, heartbeat_interval atomic, heartbeat_notify | All subsystems |
| 2 | Gateway::new() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:112` | Constructs gateway from GatewayConfig bundle, initializes AuditLogger and loads projects | GatewayConfig |
| 3 | Gateway::run() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:142` | Main event loop: starts channels, spawns API server, summarizer, scheduler, heartbeat, CLAUDE.md loops; dispatches messages via tokio::select; graceful shutdown on SIGINT | All background tasks |
| 4 | Gateway::dispatch_message() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:342` | Message dispatcher with sender buffering: if sender has active call, buffers message; otherwise processes and drains buffered messages | handle_message |
| 5 | Gateway::shutdown() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:391` | Graceful shutdown: aborts background tasks, summarizes all active conversations, stops all channels | summarize_conversation |
| 6 | Gateway::send_text() | Utility | `backend/src/gateway/mod.rs:449` | Sends a plain text message back to the sender via their channel | Channel trait |
| 7 | Gateway::handle_message() | Pipeline | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:20` | Full message pipeline: auth check, sanitize, save attachments, cross-channel identity, active project lookup, command dispatch, typing indicator, pending session checks, keyword matching, prompt building, context building, MCP matching, session persistence, model routing, provider call | All subsystems |
| 8 | Auth check | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:35` | Checks authorization and logs denied access to audit | check_auth |
| 9 | Input sanitization | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:65` | Sanitizes user input against prompt injection | sanitize::sanitize |
| 10 | Attachment saving | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:77` | Saves incoming image attachments to inbox directory with RAII cleanup guard | ensure_inbox_dir, save_attachments_to_inbox, InboxGuard |
| 11 | Cross-channel identity | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:93` | Resolves cross-channel user identity via alias system; detects new users and sets language | Store::is_new_user, find_canonical_user, create_alias, resolve_sender_id |
| 12 | Command dispatch | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:137` | Parses /commands and dispatches to command handlers; intercepts /forget and /setup specially | commands::Command::parse, commands::handle |
| 13 | Keyword matching | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:268` | Matches 9 keyword categories against message text to gate prompt sections: scheduling, recall, tasks, projects, builds, meta, profile, summaries, outcomes | kw_match, keyword arrays |
| 14 | Build request early return | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:296` | When build keywords detected, runs discovery agent before confirmation instead of normal pipeline | handle_build_keyword_discovery |
| 15 | Context building | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:328` | Builds conversation context from memory with selective loading based on ContextNeeds | Store::build_context |
| 16 | MCP server matching | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:351` | Matches skill triggers against message text to activate MCP servers | omega_skills::match_skill_triggers |
| 17 | Session-based prompt persistence | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:356` | For Claude Code CLI: reuses session_id across messages, sends minimal context update (time + conditional sections) instead of full system prompt | Store::get_session |
| 18 | Model routing | Pipeline Stage | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline.rs:419` | Routes non-build messages to fast model (Sonnet); build requests handled separately | -- |
| 19 | check_auth_inner() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/auth.rs:10` | Pure function: Telegram (allowed_users list, empty=deny), WhatsApp (allowed_users list, empty=allow), unknown channel=deny | ChannelConfig |
| 20 | handle_whatsapp_qr() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/auth.rs:68` | WhatsApp QR pairing flow: restarts bot for fresh QR, generates PNG, sends via photo, waits for pairing confirmation | WhatsAppChannel |
| 21 | handle_direct_response() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/routing.rs:18` | Direct response path: workspace image snapshot, provider call as background task, delayed status updater (15s/120s), session retry on failure, process markers, store exchange, audit log, send response, deliver workspace images | Provider, process_markers, AuditLogger |
| 22 | build_system_prompt() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/prompt_builder.rs:13` | Builds system prompt with conditional sections: identity+soul+system, provider/model info, time, platform hints, project awareness, scheduling/projects/builds/meta sections, active project ROLE.md + skills, heartbeat checklist | Prompts, projects, skills |
| 23 | handle_pending_discovery() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline_builds.rs:24` | Handles active discovery session: TTL check, cancellation, multi-round Q&A with discovery agent, produces enriched brief | parse_discovery_output, run_build_phase |
| 24 | handle_pending_build_confirmation() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline_builds.rs:249` | Handles pending build confirmation: TTL check, confirmation/cancellation/fallthrough | handle_build_request, is_build_confirmed |
| 25 | handle_build_keyword_discovery() | Service | `backend/src/gateway/pipeline_builds.rs:325` | Runs discovery agent when build keywords detected: either direct confirmation (specific request) or multi-round discovery (vague request) | run_build_phase, parse_discovery_output |

## Internal Dependencies

- handle_message() calls auth -> sanitize -> identity -> commands -> keyword matching -> prompt building -> context building -> MCP matching -> session -> model routing -> handle_direct_response()
- handle_direct_response() calls provider.complete() -> process_markers() -> store_exchange() -> audit.log() -> channel.send()
- dispatch_message() wraps handle_message() with sender buffering
- run() spawns all background tasks and the main event loop

## Dead Code / Unused

- None detected. All gateway submodules are actively used.
