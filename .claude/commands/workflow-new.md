# Workflow: New Project

The user wants to create something new from scratch. Execute the full chain.

**This is a greenfield project.** There may be no existing code, no `specs/`, and no `docs/`. Each agent must handle this gracefully — creating structure instead of reading it.

## Fail-Safe Controls

### Iteration Limits
- **QA ↔ Developer iterations (Steps 6-7):** Maximum **3 iterations**. If QA still finds blocking issues after 3 rounds, STOP and report to user: "QA iteration limit reached (3/3). Remaining issues: [list]. Requires human decision on how to proceed."
- **Reviewer ↔ Developer iterations (Steps 8-9):** Maximum **2 iterations**. If the reviewer still finds critical issues after 2 rounds, STOP and report to user: "Review iteration limit reached (2/2). Remaining issues: [list]. Requires human decision."

### Inter-Step Output Validation
Before invoking each agent, verify the previous agent produced its expected output:
- Before Analyst (Step 2): verify `docs/.workflow/idea-brief.md` exists
- Before Architect (Step 3): verify `specs/*-requirements.md` exists
- Before Test Writer (Step 4): verify `specs/*-architecture.md` exists
- Before Developer (Step 5): verify test files exist
- Before QA (Step 6): verify source code files exist
- Before Reviewer (Step 8): verify QA report exists in `docs/qa/`

**If any expected output is missing, STOP the chain** and report: "CHAIN HALTED at Step [N]: Expected output from [agent] not found. [What's missing]. Previous agent may have failed silently."

### Error Recovery
If any agent fails mid-chain:
1. Save the chain state to `docs/.workflow/chain-state.md` with:
   - Which steps completed successfully (and their output files)
   - Which step failed and why
   - What remains to be done
2. Report to user with the chain state
3. The user can resume by re-invoking the failed step's agent manually

## Step 1: Discovery
Invoke the `discovery` subagent with the user's raw idea.
The discovery agent is the ONLY agent that has extended back-and-forth conversation with the user.
1. Let it explore the idea with the user — what problem it solves, who uses it, what's essential vs. nice-to-have
2. It will challenge the idea itself — is this the right thing to build?
3. It will help the user find the MVP scope
4. Wait for the discovery agent to produce the Idea Brief at `docs/.workflow/idea-brief.md`
5. If the user's description is already detailed and specific, the discovery agent will move quickly

**Do NOT skip this step.** Even "obvious" ideas benefit from a brief validation pass.

## Step 2: Analyst
Once the Idea Brief is ready, invoke the `analyst` subagent passing both the original idea AND the Idea Brief.
1. The analyst reads `docs/.workflow/idea-brief.md` to understand the validated concept
2. If `specs/SPECS.md` exists, read it to understand any existing project layout
3. If `specs/SPECS.md` does NOT exist, skip codebase reading — this is a new project
4. Now focus on turning the Idea Brief into formal requirements — questioning technical details, edge cases, and dependencies
5. Generate the requirements document with:
   - Unique requirement IDs (REQ-[DOMAIN]-[NNN])
   - MoSCoW priorities (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
   - Acceptance criteria for every requirement
   - User stories where applicable
   - Impact analysis (if any existing code)
   - Initial traceability matrix
6. Create `specs/` directory if it doesn't exist
7. Save output to `specs/[domain]-requirements.md` and create/update `specs/SPECS.md` index

## Step 3: Architect
Once the analyst completes, invoke the `architect` subagent passing the requirements document.
1. If this is a new project (no existing code), design the full project structure:
   - Create `backend/` (and `frontend/` if needed) directory layout
   - Define module structure, interfaces, dependencies
2. Design failure modes and recovery strategies per module
3. Define security considerations and trust boundaries
4. Set performance budgets and complexity targets
5. Plan graceful degradation behavior
6. Create `specs/` and `docs/` scaffolding if they don't exist
7. Save specs to `specs/[domain].md` and create/update `specs/SPECS.md`
8. Save docs to `docs/[topic].md` and create/update `docs/DOCS.md`
9. Update the traceability matrix with architecture sections

## Step 4: Test Writer
Once the architect completes, invoke the `test-writer` subagent passing the architecture.
The test-writer works one module at a time, saving tests to disk after each.
1. Tests Must requirements first (exhaustive coverage + edge cases)
2. Tests Should requirements second (solid coverage)
3. Tests Could requirements last (basic happy path)
4. Every test references a requirement ID for traceability
5. Tests cover failure modes and security from the architect's design
6. Updates the traceability matrix with test IDs
7. All tests must fail initially (red phase)

## Step 5: Developer
Once tests are written, invoke the `developer` subagent.
The developer works one module at a time: read tests → implement → run tests → commit → next.
Must implement module by module until all tests pass.
If context gets heavy mid-implementation, commit progress and continue.

## Step 6: QA
Once all code passes the tests, invoke the `qa` subagent.
1. Verify the traceability matrix is complete (every Must/Should has tests and code)
2. Verify acceptance criteria for every Must requirement
3. Verify acceptance criteria for every Should requirement
4. Run end-to-end flows that cross module boundaries
5. Perform exploratory testing — try what no test anticipated
6. Validate failure modes and recovery strategies
7. Validate security considerations
8. Generate QA report at `docs/qa/[name]-qa-report.md`

## Step 7: QA Iteration
If QA finds blocking issues (Must requirements failing, broken flows):
- Return to the developer with the QA findings
- The developer fixes them (scoped to the affected area only)
- QA re-validates (scoped to the fix only)
- Repeat until QA approves

## Step 8: Reviewer
Once QA approves, invoke the `reviewer` subagent.
The reviewer works module by module, saving findings incrementally.
Wait for the review report, including specs/docs drift check.
Save output to `docs/reviews/[name]-review.md`.

## Step 9: Review Iteration
If the reviewer finds critical issues:
- Return to the developer with the findings
- The developer fixes them (scoped to the affected module only)
- The reviewer reviews again (scoped to the fix only)
- Repeat until approved

## Step 10: Versioning
Once approved, create the final commit and version tag.
Clean up `docs/.workflow/` temporary files.
